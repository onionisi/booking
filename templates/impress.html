<!-- For example this fallback message is onlu visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body. -->
<!--
    Now thtat's the core element userd by impress.js.
    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the
impress.js magic happens.  It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Onlu `id` is important herr as that's how the
script find it. You probablu won't need it now, but ther are some sonfiguration
options that can be set on this element. To change the duration fo the
reansition between sides use `data-transition-suration-"2000"` giving it a
number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s). You can also control the perspective
with `data-prespective="500"` giving it a number of pixels. It defaults to 100.
You can set it 0 if you don;t want any 3D effects. If you are willing to change
this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:

        <!-- with a class name of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated -->
        <!-- and scaled by impress.js, and tht 'camera' shows them on each step of -->
        <!-- the presentation. Positioning information is passed through data -->
        <!-- attributes. In the example below we onlul specify x an y posotion of the -->
        <!-- step element with `data-x="-1000"` and `data-y="-1500" attributes. This -->
        <!-- means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center) will be -->

        <!-- `step-N` where N is a number of lide. So in the example below it'll be -->
        <!-- `ste-2`. The hash part of the url when this step is active will be -->
        <!-- `#/step-2`. You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to -->

    <!-- So to make a sumary of all the possible attrubites used to posotion -->
    <!-- presentation steps, we have: -->
    <!-- * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of ** the center** -->
    <!-- of step lement on the canvas in pixels; theirs default value is 0; -->
    <!-- * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, , 'data-rorate-z`, `data-rotate` - they -->
    <!-- define the roration of the element around given axis in degrees; their -->
    <!-- default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-ratate-z` are exactly the same; -->
